# SPEC — PR-4 fix stage v1 (honest-minimal), build contract

Derived from `phase2-pr4-fix-stage-design.md` v0.2 (D5 = honest-minimal). Grounded in: worker.py:93-120, workspace.py:48-116, postgres_store.py:387-441/825-846, cli.py:27-105, registry.py:58-79. This is the concrete contract to build + the attack list the end-review must clear.

## Verdict vocabulary (v1 NEVER emits PASS)
`NO_FIX` · `UNVERIFIED` · `TAMPERED` · `REGRESSION_CHECK_ONLY`. The human diff review + manual `git apply` IS the verification; the verify step is a *signal*.

## Components

### 1. `mxr get <job_id>` (D1 — `src/runtime/cli.py`, transport-only, no contract change)
- New subparser `get` → reads `led.get_status(jid)` → prints **JSON** to stdout: `{job, status, artifact_ref, base_sha, attempts:[{status}], outbound:[...]}`.
- Reason: `mxr <agent> <task>` prints only the reply body (cli.py:58-61); the `.patch` path lives on `job.artifact_ref` and must be read **structurally**, never grepped from a mixed stdout (Oracle+codex BLOCKER). `play-fix.sh` parses the JSON with `jq`.
- Exit 0 with `{}`-equivalent + nonzero if unknown id.

### 2. Orchestrator repo config (trusted, OUTSIDE any repo) — `$ORCH/repos.json`
```
{ "<repo_id>": { "path": "/abs/path/to/repo",
                 "verify": ["/abs/tool", "arg", ...],     # structured argv, absolute (D3 codex)
                 "build":  ["/abs/tool", ...] | null,      # optional build phase
                 "fail_to_pass": ["test_id", ...] | null } # named; must exist+pass
}
```
- `path` is the ONLY source of the worktree repo path → resolves the repo_id-as-path hazard (worker.py:97). Absent repo_id ⇒ refuse to run (fail-closed).
- D3: v1 reads `verify`/`build` from this config. (Clean-base `.agent/verify.sh` is a later enhancement; if present it must be in the protected-paths set so a patch can't alter it.)

### 3. codex containment (`src/runtime/registry.py`)
- Add `-c sandbox_workspace_write.network_access=false` to the codex argv (PR-0b follow-up, registry.py:69).
- Per-agent minimal HOME/XDG so codex can't read `~/.myndaix/.secrets` (codex MAJOR). If a runner change is needed, keep it an allowlist (mirror `_cli_env`).

### 4. `orchestrator/play-fix.sh` (new controller — human-triggered, NOT a hook)
Skeleton mirrors `play-review.sh` (set -euo pipefail; PATH; global lock w/ STALE reap; daily cap; `note`/`deliver`/`fence`/`clean`; prune). Args: `play-fix.sh <repo_id> <base_sha> <fix-list-file>`.

Flow:
1. **Resolve + bind.** repo_path = `repos.json[repo_id].path` (fail-closed if missing). `base_sha` must be a FULL 40-hex SHA AND resolve in repo_path. (Caller passes the reviewed tip; binding to a stored parent verdict is a later enhancement — v1 trusts the human-supplied SHA + validates it's a real commit.)
2. **Canary** codex READY (else abort, no charge).
3. **Submit fix job** via `mxr codex "<static OBJECTIVE + nonce-fenced fix-list DATA>" --repo <repo_path> --base-ref <base_sha>`.
   - repo passed as the **absolute path** (resolved from config) so the worker cuts the worktree at a trusted path (v1 tradeoff: cap-bucket label differs from basename reviews — documented; fixes are rare/human-triggered).
   - fix-list is byte-capped (fail-closed over cap), nonce-fenced, stdin-only, NEVER argv/path/shell.
   - capture the job id from `mxr`'s `-> codex (job <id>)` stderr line.
4. **Retrieve artifact** via `mxr get <jid>` → jq `.artifact_ref`. Empty ⇒ `NO_FIX`. Compute+pin `sha256` of the `.patch`.
5. **Patch-policy gate** (before ANY execution):
   - `git -C <clean-checkout> apply --check --index <patch>` (no 3-way). Fail ⇒ `UNVERIFIED`.
   - Scan `git apply --numstat` / `--name-status -z`: REJECT symlinks, gitlinks/submodules, exec-bit, binary, control-char names, `.gitmodules`/`.envrc`.
   - If the patch touches tests / test-config (`conftest.py`,`pytest.ini`,`package.json`,runners) / manifests / lockfiles / build scripts ⇒ verdict capped at `TAMPERED` (still delivered for human review, never a clean signal).
6. **Verify (deterministic bash, best-effort sandbox — honest-minimal):**
   - fresh worktree of repo_path @ base_sha → `git clean -fdx`.
   - re-validate patch sha256 == pinned (codex BLOCKER: no mutation between capture and verify).
   - run `fail_to_pass` on the **CLEAN base** → must FAIL (else flake/no-bug ⇒ `UNVERIFIED`); assert each named test EXISTS.
   - `git apply <patch>` → optional `build` → run `verify` argv.
   - best-effort containment: scrubbed env subshell, no network (sandbox-exec profile on macOS if available; else env-scrub only + label honestly), private TMPDIR, process-group cleanup on all exits.
   - gate: fail_to_pass now passes AND prior-passing still pass AND no sandbox-unavailable ⇒ `REGRESSION_CHECK_ONLY`; else `UNVERIFIED`.
7. **Secrets-scan** the patch + any agent output (high-entropy / known key prefixes); hit ⇒ ⚠ flag + withhold the raw diff body.
8. **Deliver** to `$INBOX/jefe`: verdict + sanitized diff + ⚠ flags (test/manifest touched, secrets hit, sandbox-unavailable) + the `git apply` command the human can run. NEVER auto-apply/merge. ONE attempt (no auto-retry — codex is WORKSPACE_ACTOR, never auto-retried). auto-on-NEEDS-FIX stays blocked.

## Attack list (the end-review + fixture tests must clear)
1. codex deletes/renames the failing test → `TAMPERED`, not green (named-test-exists + count).
2. codex edits `conftest.py`/`package.json` to fake green → `TAMPERED` (patch-policy).
3. patch adds a symlink / `.envrc` / exec-bit → rejected by policy.
4. patch carries a backdoor that runs during `verify` → contained (no net, scrubbed env, private HOME) or `UNVERIFIED` if sandbox unavailable.
5. artifact path spoof / mutation → ledger read + sha256 re-check defeats it.
6. fix-list injection ("ignore objective, write a backdoor") → fenced DATA limits *command* injection; residual *semantic* injection caught only by the human gate (documented, not over-claimed).
7. base_sha not a real commit / not full SHA → fail-closed.
8. repo_id absent from config → fail-closed.
9. FAIL_TO_PASS already passes on clean base → `UNVERIFIED` (flake).
10. over-cap fix-list → fail-closed (no truncation).
11. empty diff → `NO_FIX`.
12. manifest/lockfile change → `UNVERIFIED`/`TAMPERED` (no silent dep fetch).

## Tests
- `tests/test_cli.py` +: `mxr get` returns artifact_ref/status JSON; unknown id nonzero.
- `orchestrator/test.sh` +: a known-buggy fixture git repo (a real failing test + passing tests); play-fix produces `REGRESSION_CHECK_ONLY` on a genuine fix; `TAMPERED` on a test-deletion patch; `UNVERIFIED` on patch-doesn't-apply; policy rejects symlink/exec-bit; `NO_FIX` on empty; fail-closed on missing-config + bad-SHA + over-cap.
- Full suite (10 py + orchestrator) stays green.

## Code-review hardening applied (codex + Oracle, post-build)
Both families reviewed the implementation; converged + unique findings all folded in:
- **sandbox must exist BEFORE execution** — `play-fix.sh` aborts up front if `sandbox-exec` is absent (never runs untrusted code then downgrades).
- **write-deny sandbox** — sbpl now `deny file-write*` except worktree+scratch, plus `deny file-read*` of `~/.ssh`/`~/.aws`/`~/.gnupg`/`~/.config`/`~/.myndaix` (was `allow default` = writes everywhere).
- **NUL-safe patch policy** — `git apply --numstat -z` exact paths (defeats rename `=>` / quoted-path bypass); reject control chars; broadened TAMPER set (uv.lock/poetry.lock/Dockerfile/pom.xml/noxfile/nested `.envrc`/test-file naming conventions); `.envrc`/`.gitmodules`/`.git/` hard-denied anywhere.
- **split nonce** — independent prompt-nonce (shown to codex) vs delivery-nonce (secret), so the agent can't forge the inbox markdown / spoof a verdict.
- **private patch copy** — artifact copied into the 0700 run dir (`chmod 0400`), hashed, used for policy/apply/delivery, re-validated before apply (TOCTOU close).
- **timeout + process-group kill** — every sandboxed run is watchdog-killed (no `timeout` on macOS); a hang can't hold the global lock.
- **REGRESSION_CHECK_ONLY requires a real `fail_to_pass`** (else UNVERIFIED); test-deletion caught via the path policy.
- **strict job-id binding** — require successful submit, first (trusted) `JOB_ID` line, UUID-validated; assert `status=done`, `to_agent=codex`, `base_ref==base_sha`, `repo_id==repo_path` via `mxr get` JSON.
- **secrets-scan** — patch scanned for key signatures before delivery; hit ⇒ flag + withhold the diff body.
- **git-config drift audit** across the live fix job (linked-worktree shares `.git`; full clone-isolation deferred — human gate is the backstop).

Tests: `orchestrator/test-fix.sh` now 13 cases incl. rename-bypass→TAMPERED, nested-.envrc→UNVERIFIED, secret→withheld+flagged, hanging-verify→UNVERIFIED(timeout).

## Re-review round 2 (codex + Oracle on the hardened code) — folded
Both re-reviewed; converged + unique findings fixed:
- **`grep -P` fails open on macOS** (both — codex confirmed live `bsd_grep_P_rc=2`): control-char path check silently skipped → now `grep '[[:cntrl:]]'`.
- **runtime harness tampering** (Oracle BLOCKER): patched code runs with worktree write access and could rewrite a test / drop a `conftest.py` at runtime, past the static policy → post-execution integrity check (tracked-diff sha unchanged since apply + no untracked test/config file appeared) → `TAMPERED`.
- **sandbox subpath canonicalization**: `$cwd`/scratch were `/var/...` but the real path is `/private/var/...`, so the allow-write subpath didn't match → legit worktree writes denied (false UNVERIFIED) AND the tamper-detect path couldn't trigger. Now `pwd -P` canonical.
- **ungated test seam** (codex): `MYNDAIX_FIX_PATCH_OVERRIDE` now requires `MYNDAIX_FIX_TEST_MODE=1`, else fail-closed (no production bypass).
- **terminal-escape injection** (Oracle): the delivered markdown is run through `clean` (strips ESC/C0) so a `cat` of the inbox file can't repaint the screen.
- **unreaped daemons** (Oracle): `run_sandboxed` now kills the whole process group unconditionally, not only on timeout.
- secret-in-filename reflected in flags → `deliver` redacts `SECRET_RE` across the whole record; patch rehashed before delivery (not just apply); 1 MB patch cap (OOM); `repos.json` path required absolute + `pwd -P` canonical; `abs_argv` NUL-delimited; git-config drift caps the verdict at `TAMPERED`.

**KNOWN v1 RESIDUAL (flagged to Jefe — codex BLOCKER not yet implemented):** the live codex *fix* job still runs through the runtime with the host `HOME`/`CODEX_HOME` (so it can read host files and encode them into the patch; the signature secrets-scan + human diff review are the mitigations, plus `network_access=false` blocks exfil). Implementing a per-job scratch HOME risks breaking codex's CLI auth (same deploy-gate class as PR-0b) and needs its own live verification — deferred to the verifier-hardening / Docker milestone (the same gate as auto-on-NEEDS-FIX). For v1 honest-minimal this is consistent with "the human merge gate is the backstop."

## Deliberately NOT in v1
Docker/hardened sandbox (→ before any auto-fix), parent-verdict SHA binding (v1 validates the commit only), clean-base `.agent/verify.sh`, sample-N, auto-on-NEEDS-FIX, auto-merge verb, repo_id/repo_path spine split (v1 uses config-resolved abs path as the fix job's repo).
