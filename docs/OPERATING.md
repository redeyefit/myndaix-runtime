# Operating the runtime

The runtime runs as two pieces against one Postgres database: a long-lived worker-pool
**service** that drains the queue and runs jobs through the real agent CLIs, and a thin
**`mxr` CLI** that submits a task and prints the agent's reply. You name the agent; the
runtime dispatches it durably and hands back the result — direct ops, no orchestrator in
the loop.

> First-time install (Python deps, Postgres, the agent CLIs, one machine and two) is in
> **[../SETUP.md](../SETUP.md)**. This doc is the day-to-day operating reference.

## One-time setup

Prerequisites: Python 3.11+, a running Postgres 16, and the runtime's deps installed
(`pip install -e .` from the repo root, or `pip install asyncpg fastapi uvicorn httpx pydantic`).
Run the schema load from the repo root (the path is relative):

```bash
createdb runtime
psql runtime < src/runtime/ledger/schema.sql   # from the repo root; load once
export MYNDAIX_DSN=postgresql://localhost/runtime
```

## Run the service

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m runtime.serve            # foreground; Ctrl-C to stop (--size N for N workers)
```

## Submit a task

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m runtime.cli kilabz "one-line review: def add(a,b): return a-b"
```

A convenient wrapper on your `PATH` (e.g. `~/.local/bin/mxr`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
export MYNDAIX_DSN="${MYNDAIX_DSN:-postgresql://localhost/runtime}"
export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/your/myndaix-runtime/src"   # <- set to YOUR clone's path
exec python3 -m runtime.cli "$@"
```

then `mxr kilabz "review the diff in ..."`. Point `PYTHONPATH` at *your* checkout — a fresh
`git clone` lands in `./myndaix-runtime` wherever you ran it, so the path above is just an example.
(If you `pip install -e .` into a venv, drop the `PYTHONPATH` line and call that venv's `python`.)

The agent it dispatches to must have its CLI installed and authenticated in the service's
environment (see the roster in `src/runtime/registry.py`).

## Always-on (macOS launchd)

The service is idle — just polling Postgres — until you submit work, so an always-on pool is
cheap: it only invokes an agent when there's a job to run. To keep it running across logins,
save the plist below as `~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.myndaix.runtime.plist`, then
`launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.myndaix.runtime.plist`.

Fill in three things (and get them right — a background process is unforgiving):

1. **`<REPO>`** — the absolute path to your clone, and **`/Users/you`** — your real `$HOME`.
2. **`PATH`** — launchd does *not* inherit your shell `PATH`. List every dir holding an agent
   CLI: your npm-global bin (`claude`, `codex`) and `~/.local/bin` (`agy`). A missing dir means
   every job for that agent fails with the CLI "not found".
3. **Secrets** — to give the service API keys (e.g. `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` for `recon`), don't put
   them in the plist. Point `ProgramArguments` at a small wrapper that sources a `chmod 600` env
   file first, e.g. a `runtime-serve.sh` containing:
   `set -a; . "$HOME/.myndaix/.secrets"; set +a; exec <REPO>/.venv/bin/python -m runtime.serve --size 4`
   — then the plist runs `/bin/bash <REPO>/runtime-serve.sh`. (The `.venv` path assumes you ran
   `python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e .`; otherwise call `python3` with `PYTHONPATH`.)

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0"><dict>
  <key>Label</key><string>ai.myndaix.runtime</string>
  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string><REPO>/.venv/bin/python</string><string>-m</string><string>runtime.serve</string>

  <key>WorkingDirectory</key><string><REPO></string>
  <key>EnvironmentVariables</key><dict>

    <key>HOME</key><string>/Users/you</string>
    <key>PATH</key><string>/Users/you/.npm-global/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/bin:/bin</string>
  </dict>
  <key>RunAtLoad</key><true/>
  <key>KeepAlive</key><true/>
  <key>StandardErrorPath</key><string><REPO>/.runtime.log</string>
</dict></plist>
```

Stop it with `launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.myndaix.runtime.plist`. Logs go to
`.runtime.log`. The launchd service runs agents non-interactively, so each agent CLI must be
authenticated in a way a background process can read (an env API key or a cached token).

## `mxr` (durable) vs direct `codex exec` / `agy -p` (raw)

Same underlying agent CLI, two different jobs:

- **`mxr <agent>` — the durable path.** Goes through the Postgres ledger: the job/attempt is
  recorded, leased, heartbeated, crash-recovered, and the reply delivered via the outbox. Use it
  for **anything that must survive a crash, be retried, or be auditable** — pipeline steps,
  builds, the orchestrator's reviews.
- **Direct `codex exec …` / `agy -p …` — the raw path.** A one-shot CLI call: no ledger, no
  lease, no retry, no record — you read the output and it's gone. Use it for a **quick one-off**
  (an ad-hoc review/check) where durability doesn't matter.

Decision rule: *does this need to be remembered/recovered?* No → direct CLI. Yes → `mxr`.

Gotchas:
- **`agy` (Oracle / Gemini — it replaced the retired `gemini` CLI) must be run with `< /dev/null`**
  or it hangs on inherited stdin (0% CPU, no output): `agy -p "<prompt>" < /dev/null`.
- `codex exec`/`agy` are allowlisted, so an interactive Claude Code session can call them directly;
  `mxr` from inside an *auto-mode* agent session is classifier-gated — trigger durable work via a
  **human or a hook** (e.g. the orchestrator below), not the agent.

## Orchestrator: review-on-push (optional layer)

`orchestrator/play-review.sh` turns the runtime into autonomous code review: install it as a
**`pre-push` hook** and every `git push` is reviewed by the team, verdict delivered to you — no
terminal needed.

- **Flow:** push → (detached; never blocks the push) live canary → review (`kilabz`) → triage
  (`lobster` → fix-list or the exact token `PLAY_PASS`) → deliver to
  **`~/.myndaix/bridge/inbox/jefe/` + a one-way iMessage** (`PLAY_IMESSAGE_TO`). Reviews any
  branch (`refs/heads/*`); a new branch diffs vs `merge-base(main, tip)`.
- **Install** (from the repo root):
  ```bash
  ln -sf "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/orchestrator/play-review.sh" "$(git rev-parse --git-path hooks)/pre-push"
  ```
- **Config (env):** `PLAY_DAILY_CAP` (default 50) · `PLAY_IMESSAGE_TO` (empty disables the ping).
- **Test:** `bash orchestrator/test.sh` (stubbed agents — no real dispatch).
- **Why a hook:** *your* `git push` is the trigger (a non-Claude originator), so it dispatches the
  durable `mxr` reviews an auto-mode agent can't trigger itself. Verdicts go only to the human
  `jefe/` inbox (no agent watches it) — the merge stays your call. Design: `docs/orchestrator-design.md`.
