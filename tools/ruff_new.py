"""Block ruff findings that are NEW vs a base commit; never block pre-existing debt.

The repo carries ~48 pre-existing findings under the current [tool.ruff.lint] select (see
`ruff check --statistics .`) — too many to gate whole-repo without freezing every future PR that
merely touches a file with old debt in it. This is a finding-diff RATCHET, the same semantics as
semgrep --baseline-commit: for every .py file the change touches, findings present in BOTH the
base commit's version and the current version are "inherited" (never block); findings present
only in the current version are "new" (block). A file with zero .py changes is never linted at
all, so untouched debt anywhere else in the tree is invisible to this gate — see
`ruff check --exit-zero --statistics .` in CI for the whole-repo burn-down number.

Matching is by (file, rule code, message) as a multiset, NOT by line number: editing anywhere
else in a file shifts line numbers for pre-existing findings below the edit, and a naive
line-keyed diff would misreport untouched debt as "new" on every such edit (this is why
touching controller.py's PLW1510-heavy region for an unrelated fix must still report 0 new).
Message text includes enough specificity (variable/import names) that two distinct real
violations of the same rule in the same file essentially never collide.

Base-commit content is linted from a temp mirror, not a full `git worktree`/checkout, because
running ruff needs the SAME pyproject.toml applied to old and new content — a difference in
findings must come from content, never from the rule set changing between commits (this PR's own
diff, which is the FIRST commit to populate [tool.ruff.lint] select, would otherwise show every
pre-existing finding as "new" simply because the base commit's pyproject.toml had no select at
all). The mirror preserves each file's CURRENT (head) relative path — not its base-commit path —
so path-based config like `[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]` ("tests/**") is evaluated
consistently for both sides of a renamed file.

Usage:
    python tools/ruff_new.py <base-ref> [--config PATH]

Exit codes:
    0 — no changed .py files, or changed files produced zero new findings.
    1 — one or more new findings (printed to stdout).
    2 — could not run: ruff missing from PATH, base ref unresolvable, a git/ruff invocation
        failed, or ruff's JSON output was unparseable. This path NEVER prints "0 new findings" —
        an inability to check is not a pass.
