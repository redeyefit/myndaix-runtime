"""Review snapshot staging — the RAW OBJECT EXPORTER (docs/mxr-review-context-design.md D1).

Stages an ephemeral, de-linked, non-writable snapshot of a repo at a reviewed tip, to
become a CONFINED reviewer's cwd (kilabz/lobster; runner validates the path — D2/D3).
The snapshot is additive "verify against real code"; the inlined fenced diff stays the
review's source of truth, so every staging failure has an inline-only fallback (§4).

WHY a raw exporter and not git's own machinery (all three verified during design review):
- `git archive` honors in-tree `.gitattributes export-ignore` — a hostile PR can silently
  HIDE whole directories from the snapshot.
- `git checkout-index` (and any checkout path) runs attribute processing: `* text eol=crlf`
  / `ident` mutate staged bytes (silent divergence from the fenced diff), and a `filter=`
  driver reference executes HOST-side during staging (SSRF/RCE class on the orchestrator,
  outside any agent sandbox). It also materializes committed symlinks LIVE.
The raw walk (`ls-tree -r -z` + per-blob `cat-file blob`) kills all three by construction:
nothing consults .gitattributes, symlink blobs are written as regular files CONTAINING the
target string (inert), gitlinks are skipped, and no exec bits are set.

HOSTILE TREE PATHS (kilabz r3 CRITICAL): bypassing checkout also bypassed git's
`verify_path()` — so this module REIMPLEMENTS it. ls-tree paths come from an UNTRUSTED
tree object; a hand-crafted tree can contain `..`, `.git` (any case / HFS-ignorable-char
variants), duplicates, or case-colliding names (silent overwrite on case-insensitive APFS).
Per entry, BEFORE writing: reject absolute paths, empty/`.`/`..` components, any component
that case-insensitively normalizes to `.git` (or the NTFS `git~1` alias); create files
O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW (duplicates and case collisions fail LOUDLY, never collapse); verify the
final path is strictly under the run dir. ANY violation raises StagingError — the caller's
§4 policy decides (gate mode fails closed; the human loop degrades loudly to inline-only).

Every git step's exit is asserted independently (no pipeline), each under a hard timeout,
and a final count check (files written == ls-tree blob count) makes partial exports loud.

PR-2 seam: `python3 -m runtime.staging stage|teardown|reap ...` gives play-review.sh the
same exporter without a bash reimplementation.
