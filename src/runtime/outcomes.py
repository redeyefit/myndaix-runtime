"""Pure, DB-free core for the outcomes-ledger rung (the per-finding OUTCOME LABEL) — v0.3.

Kept separate from the ledger/play-review wiring so the finding IDENTITY (path-scoped line-hash),
the `finding:` line parser, and the hunk-validation resolve are unit-testable WITHOUT a DB or git
(mirrors runtime.capture, the sibling rung's pure layer). NO LLM decides identity or validity here:
the rule_tag is an ALLOWLISTED, version-controlled taxonomy (shared with capture, single source of
truth), the line CONTENT is read from git OBJECTS at the reviewed tip, and every malformed finding
is DROPPED fail-closed (never raised, never a silent mis-key).

DESIGN: docs/outcomes-ledger-design.md (v0.3 — cross-family reviewed). The append-only state machine
(record_findings close+open, human_dismiss, expire_open) lives in ledger.postgres_store; the git-
object read is done via an injected `run_git` callable so this file stays pure/deterministic.

Identity rules (design §3, the v0.1 CRIT fix):
  * line_hash    = sha256 of the WHITESPACE-NORMALIZED line CONTENT — never the line NUMBER, so the
                   identity survives diff shifts. Normalize = collapse internal whitespace runs to a
                   single space + strip ends. Two identical NORMALIZED lines in the SAME file
                   legitimately collide (accepted, like SonarQube).
  * finding_key  = sha256(repo_id \0 rule_tag \0 path \0 line_hash) — PATH IS IN THE KEY: identical
                   normalized lines in DIFFERENT files must NOT collide, and a crafted diff line
                   cannot mint a legit finding's key without touching that finding's own file.
