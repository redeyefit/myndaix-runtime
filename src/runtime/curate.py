"""curate.py — `mxr curate`: the curator rung's deterministic GUARD (docs/curator-design.md v0.4).

The LLM never touches the live corpus. The guard: (1) resolves the scope from the static
allowlist, (2) refreshes the derived index + runs recall, (3) STAGES a filtered copy of the
corpus (the read boundary IS the copy: eligible *.md only + MANIFEST.txt + runtime-authored
path-scoped permissions), (4) dispatches the pool `curator` agent with cwd = the staging dir,
(5) PROMOTES only validated changes back (new valid *.md + index.md), under a promote journal,
CAS-checked against the live corpus, committed per-file with hardened git — anything else is
NONCOMPLIANT: nothing lands, staging is kept for inspection.

Lock discipline (design v0.4): the per-scope advisory lock is held for the refresh (inside
knowledge_sync) and re-acquired for the promote window; it is NOT held across the LLM wait.
Concurrent curates both run; the second promote CAS-aborts on a real conflict.

Exit codes: 0 = compliant (or no changes) · 1 = noncompliant / conflict / agent failure ·
2 = usage / unknown scope.
