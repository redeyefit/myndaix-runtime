"""Pure, DB-free logic for the +learning rung's review-skill selection + safety scan.

Kept separate from postgres_store / skillselect / controller so the matching + injection
logic is unit-testable WITHOUT a database (mirrors automerge.classify_diff being a pure,
adversarially-tested core). Imported by:
  - runtime.ledger.postgres_store.select_skills  — path-segment match + specificity ordering
  - runtime.skillselect                          — inject-time injection tripwire
  - runtime.controller (indexer lint)            — banned-trigger + injection scan at promotion

DESIGN: docs/learning-rung-plan.md Step 2/3/5 + design v0.3 #6 (path-segment matching) and
v0.3.2 (the injection tripwire, borrowed from openclaw and NARROWED for our context).

# depth ON TOP of the nonce-fence: the fence makes the body DATA; this drops an obviously
# adversarial body before it reaches a reviewer (skillselect) or before it is ever promoted
# to `active` (controller index lint). Mirrors openclaw's hasReviewerDirective tripwire.
#
# DELIBERATELY NARROW: a legitimate REVIEW skill is DESCRIPTIVE about code review — it will
# naturally say "flag any `curl ... | sh`", "reject if it auto-approves", "check env vars".
# So we do NOT scan for those content words (openclaw's SKILL_CONTENT_RULES do, because their
# learned skills describe TASKS, not reviews) — they would false-positive the very skills we
# want and make the rung unusable. We catch ONLY directives that try to RE-FRAME the reviewer
# (role-override / "ignore instructions" / system-prompt spoof / fence break), which a genuine
# descriptive review skill has no reason to contain. [Patterns are a security judgment call —
# scrutinize in review; tune toward fewer false-negatives only with evidence.]
