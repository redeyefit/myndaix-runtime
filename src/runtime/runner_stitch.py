"""Stitcher (workspace-actor): build a long video from a shot-list.

Per shot: generate a clip via DoP (runner._hf_generate), chaining the previous shot's
last frame as the next shot's start image for continuity; download each clip; then
ffmpeg-concat and apply a DETERMINISTIC brand layer (the HYBRID rule — AI for the moving
b-roll, exact tools for the logo/end-card, because models can't render a logo pixel-exact).

One self-contained job (NOT N ledger sub-jobs) so the whole spend sits under one cost
ceiling. authority=WORKSPACE_ACTOR -> the worker NEVER auto-retries it, so a failed run is
never silently re-charged. Partial failure returns the clips that DID succeed, concatenated
— spend on good shots is never thrown away.

NOTE (v1): there is no cross-run RESUME. The worker creates and destroys a fresh worktree
per attempt, so any in-workspace state (clips, a manifest) does not survive between runs;
combined with never-auto-retried, an in-run manifest would be dead weight. Idempotent resume
(persisted clips keyed by a stable run id, skip-already-charged) is deferred to v2.

Shot-list (job.context["shotlist"]) = ordered list of dicts:
  {prompt, motion_id?, motion_strength?, image_url?, end_image_url?, application?}
Job-level context: image_url (base/first seed), chain (bool, default True), end_card_url
(branded end-card image URL to append — SSRF-guarded), application (default model path).
