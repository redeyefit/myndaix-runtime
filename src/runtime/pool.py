"""Concurrent worker pool (DESIGN.md C4) - what the lease/reclaim machinery was
built for. The sequential `worker.drain()` never exercised it; this does.

`size` workers + a janitor all lease off the SAME ledger:
  * FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED hands each worker a DIFFERENT job -> no double-process;
  * the janitor periodically `reclaim_expired()`s, so a crashed worker's job is
    requeued and finished by another worker - the pool survives worker death;
  * each worker HEARTBEATS its in-flight job, so a healthy long job is NOT
    reclaimed (only genuinely dead workers lose their lease).

Robustness (a 'dumb supervisor' must survive its workers):
  * a worker NEVER dies on a poison job - any unexpected error is caught, the
    attempt is failed TERMINAL (so it isn't reclaimed forever), and the worker
    keeps going. The runner is also total (spawn/api failures become Results).
  * the janitor survives a transient ledger error (caught + continue).
  * idle is judged against the ledger's real queue depth, not just local counters.
  * shutdown is bounded: stragglers are cancelled after a grace period.

Single-process asyncio (the per-box shape). Horizontal scale = more processes
pointing at the same Postgres - the ledger is the only shared state.
