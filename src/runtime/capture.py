"""Pure, DB-free core for the auto-capture rung (the proposer) — v0.4.

Kept separate from the ledger/controller/proposer so the recurrence keying, slug/path isolation,
and deterministic drafting are unit-testable WITHOUT a DB or gh (mirrors runtime.skillmatch). NO
LLM decides recurrence or safety here: the recurrence class is a reviewer-emitted, ALLOWLISTED
`rule:<tag>` (S3), the skill body is rendered from a FIXED template over structured fields (S4),
and the proposal path is asserted to be EXACTLY skills/<slug>/SKILL.md (S1).

DESIGN: docs/auto-capture-design.md (v0.4 — REQUIRED SAFEGUARDS S1/S3/S4 live here). The DB state
machine (S6) lives in ledger.postgres_store; the gh/git side effects (S5/S7) live in the proposer.
