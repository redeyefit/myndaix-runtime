"""C5 - workspace isolation.

A `workspace-actor` job runs in an **ephemeral git worktree** created from a
pinned ref. It mutates ONLY that tree; its changes are captured as a diff
artifact (never auto-merged); the live repo is never touched mid-flight. Two
concurrent actors get separate worktrees, so they can't corrupt a shared repo -
the failure a single-threaded runtime only prevented by accident.

The runner enforces cwd=worktree (C5); this class manages the worktree lifecycle.

Crash recovery (PR-1c): the graceful path removes a worktree in the worker's
`finally`, but a HARD crash (SIGKILL, power loss) leaves an orphan. So the root
is STABLE and shared (from $MYNDAIX_WORKTREE_ROOT or a fixed tmp path, NOT a
per-process mkdtemp), worktree dirs are named by `attempt_id`, and `sweep()` GCs
any whose attempt is no longer open - which a NEW process can run over a DEAD
one's leftovers precisely because the root is shared.
