"""outcomerecord.py — outcomes-ledger INSTRUMENTATION (the per-finding OUTCOME LABEL wiring). It
wires PR-A's pure core (runtime.outcomes) + append-only verbs (record_findings / human_dismiss /
expire_open / outcome_stats) into three `mxr` entry points. Like capturerecord it NEVER opens a PR,
NEVER acts on the data (v1 COLLECTS ONLY), and is FAIL-OPEN throughout — the review pipeline runs
over UNTRUSTED diffs, so a hung or erroring outcome path can never delay a verdict, wedge the review
lock, or change a gate decision.

Three verbs (routed via `mxr`, so each inherits the runtime venv + PYTHONPATH + DSN):
  - `mxr outcome-record --list-tags`
        print the allowlisted taxonomy (one per line) for play-review to embed in the `finding:`
        prompt — SINGLE source of truth (shared with capture), so the prompt list can't drift.
  - `mxr outcome-record --kilabz <text> --oracle <text> -- <repo_path> <base> <tip> <ref> <play>
        [changed_path...]`
        for EACH family separately: parse `finding:<tag> @ <path>:<line>` lines, resolve+hash each
        against git OBJECTS at <tip> (validating the line falls inside a changed hunk from
        `git diff <base> <tip> -- <path>`), build the open_findings list, compute present_hashes per
        changed path, call led.record_findings (CLOSE + OPEN), sweep expiries, then print the
        recorded finding keys (short 12-hex) + family so play-review can surface them.
  - `mxr outcome <finding_key_prefix> fp|wontfix`
        the human dismissal (fail-CLOSED on an ambiguous / <12-hex prefix — prints colliding keys).
  - `mxr outcome-stats`
        print the finding_precision_raw rows + open count (human-readable) for the morning brain-check.

CONTRACT (mirrors capturerecord): default OFF ($ORCH/OUTCOMES_ENABLED gate is enforced in the
play-review WIRING, not here — this verb records whatever it's handed); HARD no-op in gate mode
(PLAY_GATE); FAIL-OPEN always. All diagnostics to stderr; the recorded-keys / stats / --list-tags
payloads go to stdout.

DESIGN: docs/outcomes-ledger-design.md (v0.3). The identity/parser/resolve math is in the pure core
(runtime.outcomes); the append-only state machine lives in the ledger verbs.
