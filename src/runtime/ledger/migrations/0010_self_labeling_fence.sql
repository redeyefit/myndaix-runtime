-- Migration 0010: self-labeling fence (docs/self-labeling-design.md v0.4, dual-family APPROVE).
--
-- PR-1 = THE FENCE ONLY (no labeler yet). It HEALS 0008's finding_outcome so machine-proposed
-- labels can NEVER reach the autonomy-gating metric OR remove a finding from the human queue until
-- a HUMAN confirms. Append-only rule: this evolves the schema via guarded ALTER; NEVER edit 0008.
--
-- The fence is a closed algebra over (outcome_source, outcome):
--   • GATING inputs  = human sources only {human_confirm, human_dismiss} -> finding_precision_promoted
--   • LABEL-terminal = the same two human sources only -> a machine never leaves finding_labelqueue
--   • LIFECYCLE      = ttl_sweep/expired ages out a stale unlabeled finding (a tombstone, not a label)
-- Write-authority (the three server-minted verbs + principal->source matrix) lives in postgres_store.
--
-- Idempotent (DROP/ADD CONSTRAINT, IF (NOT) EXISTS, CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW); re-run every serve boot
-- under migrate()'s advisory lock. 0008/schema.sql recreate finding_precision every boot; this drops
-- it every boot AFTER (filename order) — a harmless recreate/drop that nets to "gone".

-- (1) Widen the two INDEPENDENT value CHECKs (each a SUPERSET of 0008's, so ADD CONSTRAINT can never
--     reject an existing row). New label sources + a human-REAL source; new label outcomes.
ALTER TABLE finding_outcome DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS finding_outcome_outcome_check;
ALTER TABLE finding_outcome ADD  CONSTRAINT finding_outcome_outcome_check CHECK (outcome IN
    ('open','applied_fixed','dismissed_false_positive','dismissed_wontfix','reverted','expired',

-- (2) Source-aware idempotency: add outcome_source to the unique tuple so cross-source events can
--     never collide or silently shadow a human promotion. New index name; drop the 4-col one.
--     (The four existing ON CONFLICT writers are updated to the 5-col target in postgres_store.py.)

-- (3) finding_current_human: ONE current HUMAN label per (finding_key, reviewer_family) — the ONLY
--     source of the gating metric. Latest human row by seq (a correction has a higher seq); no
--     machine row can appear here (WHERE clause), so DISTINCT ON needs no precedence trick.

-- (4) finding_precision_promoted: THE autonomy-facing metric. confirmed_real / (confirmed_real +
--     dismissed_false_positive) over CURRENT HUMAN labels only. Machine outcomes are structurally
--     absent (finding_current_human excludes them); the CUT lever (applied_fixed) is absent too.

 GROUP BY rule_tag, reviewer_family;

-- (5) finding_labelqueue: the human queue + the labeler sweep input. A (finding_key, family) is
--     present iff it has NO human label AND is not lifecycle-tombstoned (expired). EVERY machine
--     LABEL source (panel_proposed, exec_verified, auto_fix_landed, review_raised, auto_git_revert)
--     is invisible to terminal resolution — a machine can NEVER remove a finding from this queue.

-- (6) Rename the v1 all-source precision to _raw (diagnostic-only, the accuracy-audit baseline). The
--     ONLY autonomy-facing name is finding_precision_promoted; no all-source view keeps a
--     gating-suggestive name, and there is NO finding_current_resolved (oracle r3 attractive-nuisance).
