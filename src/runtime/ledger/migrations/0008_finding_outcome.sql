-- Migration 0008: finding_outcome — the outcomes-ledger rung (the per-finding OUTCOME LABEL).
-- Append-only event log + computed views on the existing spine (v0.3, cross-family reviewed).
-- Idempotent (CREATE TABLE/INDEX IF NOT EXISTS, CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW); re-run on every serve()
-- boot under migrate()'s advisory lock. Inert until play-review wiring lands (PR-B) + the
-- OUTCOMES_ENABLED flag is set. Design: docs/outcomes-ledger-design.md.
--
-- This migration is being authored on the (unmerged, never-applied) feat/outcomes-ledger branch, so
-- there is nothing to HEAL. Once it lands on main the migration-append-only rule applies: evolve the
-- schema via a guarded ALTER, never by editing this CREATE.
--
-- WHY: every review the brain runs is fire-and-forget — nothing records what HAPPENED to each
-- finding (fixed? dismissed as wrong? expired?). Without that label there is no ground truth, so no
-- per-class precision, no evidence-based autonomy widening. The fix is the universal prior-art
-- pattern (GitHub code-scanning / Semgrep / SonarQube): a per-finding STATE MACHINE with a STABLE
-- identity across reviews (path-scoped line-hash) and a CONSTRAINED dismissal enum. NO LLM anywhere
-- in the pipeline. v1 COLLECTS ONLY — no dial acts on the data.

-- One append-only EVENT per (finding, reviewer_family, outcome, source_event). NEVER UPDATE/DELETE.
-- Current state is COMPUTED (finding_current view): the latest human row if one exists (human-
-- terminal precedence), else the latest machine row, ordered by `seq` (a timestamp can tie and a
-- uuid is unordered — kilabz). `line_hash` is a stored COLUMN (not just folded into finding_key) so
-- the CLOSE phase can ask "is this hash still in the file" without rescanning.

-- CURRENT STATE per (finding_key, reviewer_family): a HUMAN row (dismissed_*) is TERMINAL — it
-- outranks any later machine row (human-terminal precedence, enforced here so a view reader sees the

-- key×family under the ORDER BY: human rows first (outcome_source='human_dismiss' -> rank 0), then
-- by seq DESC, so a dismissed_* row always beats a later applied_fixed/open/expired for that key.
