-- Migration 0005: skill / skill_use — the "+learning" rung (review skills) cache + audit.
--
-- Idempotent (CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS); re-run on every serve() boot behind the
-- migrate() advisory lock. Inert until runtime.controller (indexer) + runtime.skillselect run.
--
--   psql "$MYNDAIX_DSN" -f src/runtime/ledger/migrations/0005_skill.sql
--
-- WHY (learning-rung DESIGN v0.3, governing sections): a review skill is a
-- skills/<name>/SKILL.md promoted ONLY by a human PR-merge under branch protection. On-disk
-- markdown + git history stay the human-facing source, but the BODY lives HERE (Postgres is
-- the runtime read path): the controller/automerge review owned refs / base..tip OBJECTS, not
-- the worktree, so a selector must NOT rehash a possibly-stale/dirty/unmerged SKILL.md off
-- disk (codex MAJOR) — the indexer reads the body from the trusted merged ref and stores it
-- here; skillselect reads from Postgres. `provenance` is stamped server-side at the human arm,
-- never copied from the artifact (an agent cannot self-promote). Selection is per-repo and is
-- injected ONLY into push/controller reviews, NEVER a merge-gating (PLAY_GATE) review.
-- Everything is reversible (archive-not-delete): prune flips `state`, never deletes a row/file.
--   state: active -> stale -> archived  (by inactivity; reactivation = human re-arm only)
-- NOTE: this CREATE is the ORIGINAL (single-column `name` PK). The PK is corrected to the
-- composite (repo_scope, name) by the APPEND-ONLY migration 0006_skill_pk.sql — never edit a
-- shipped migration's CREATE in place (a DB that already ran this file would keep the old PK,
-- since migrate() re-runs via CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS). schema.sql (fresh DBs) carries the
-- final composite PK directly. See 0006 for the why (cross-repo same-name collision).
