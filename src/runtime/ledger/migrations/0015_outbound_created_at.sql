-- outbound.created_at — deterministic "latest reply" ordering for `mxr get --reply`
-- (phone-surface review r1 M-9: json_agg without ORDER BY made bodies[-1] arbitrary,
-- and outbound ids are UUID4 — no insertion-order correlation). Existing rows backfill
-- to now(): pre-migration order across old rows is unknowable, and every job in the
-- current flows has at most one outbound row, so the backfill is inert in practice.
-- Idempotent: serve re-runs all migrations on every boot.
ALTER TABLE outbound ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now();
