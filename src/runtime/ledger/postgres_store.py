"""asyncpg-backed PostgresLedger - the production CommandAPI (DESIGN.md C2).

The SQLite store (sqlite_store.py) and this one implement the SAME Command-API
verbs; persistence swaps behind the contract. This is where the design's core
thesis lives: row-locking + a status-guarded state machine end the concurrency
bug classes that file-IPC caused (double-lease, lost update, dup delivery, a
crashed worker's job stuck forever).

Design rules, enforced everywhere below:
  * ONE transaction per verb. The Command API is the only writer.
  * Every transition is a status-guarded compare-and-swap:
        UPDATE ... WHERE <pk> AND status IN (<legal sources>) RETURNING id
    zero rows back => the move was illegal/already-done => the named no-op path.
  * Where two writers can collide on the same row we take a row lock:
        FOR UPDATE          - serialize (admission, complete-vs-reclaim)
        FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED - hand DISTINCT rows to concurrent workers (lease, claim)
  * READ COMMITTED isolation (Postgres default) is sufficient: correctness comes
    from the locks + the WHERE re-check, not from snapshot isolation.
  * ONE canonical lock order everywhere: attempt-row THEN job-row THEN
    repo_concurrency-row (the per-repo cap counter is ALWAYS locked LAST). Holding
    to a single order is what keeps the locks deadlock-free, so no verb raises a
    serialization/deadlock error and no retry loop is needed. (A cancel() that
    locked job-then-attempt formed an ABBA cycle with complete/fail/reclaim - a
    real deadlock caught by adversarial review; cancel now locks attempt-first.)
    lease_job locks the job (PICK) before the rc row, and its hard COUNT is a
    NON-locking read, so it never holds an attempt lock while waiting on the job.
    Multi-repo writers (reclaim batch, reconciler) lock rc rows in repo_id order.
  * authority (retry-safety) is NOT in the DB - only job.to_agent is - so the
    retry decision consults the registry (fail-closed on unknown agents).

        never depends on it (the hard COUNT under the rc lock at lease time is the cap

             so a MISSING row is created (a missing row reads 0 -> over-FILTERS, never
             over-admits since the hard COUNT gates).
          2. Zero any rc row whose repo now has no live open attempts (drift-down).

        whose ORIGIN ref (the ref its EARLIEST 'open' row was raised on) EXACTLY matches this review's

        an 'applied_fixed' row (source_event 'review:<play>', outcome_source auto_fix_landed).

        The present-set is the design's actual CLOSE contract (§2): `present_hashes[path]` = the SET of
        line_hashes actually in that file at tip_sha (the caller computes it via
        outcomes.file_line_hashes per changed path — git OBJECTS, never the worktree). It is NOT "the
        reviewer re-flagged this line": a PASS review, or a review of an unrelated line in the same
        file, raises no `finding:` for the still-real issue, yet the issue's line is STILL in the file
        — so deriving 'present' from re-flags would false-close every open finding in a touched file.
        present_hashes[path] is THREE-STATE (core-audit HIGH): an EMPTY set = the file is CONFIRMED
        absent at tip (deleted/renamed) -> every finding in it closes (design-accepted §6); a populated
        set closes only the findings whose line is gone; and None = presence could NOT be determined (a
        transient git error) -> fail-CLOSED, leave the finding OPEN (a transient failure must never
        fabricate an applied_fixed and poison the ground truth). A path absent from the dict is treated
        as None (don't close). In PR-A tests supply present_hashes directly (keeps the verb DB-only, no
        git in postgres_store); PR-B wiring computes it per path via outcomes.file_line_hashes.

        ORIGIN-ref scoping (not finding_current's drifting latest-row ref): a finding opened on ref A
        must not be closed by a review on ref B even if the line is gone at B's tip. EXACT ref match,
        not default-branch closure — a main review must not close a finding raised on an unrelated
        feature branch whose fix never merged (design §2, v1 scope).

        OPEN — for each finding in `open_findings` INSERT an 'open' row, SKIPPING any (finding_key,

        'this reviewer was wrong' suppresses re-detection, which is what the stable key exists FOR)

        keys-files). Re-raise after 'expired' or 'applied_fixed' is allowed (a regression).

        writes a human-terminal row that finding_current_human + finding_labelqueue treat as gating +
        queue-terminal, so it takes the SAME principal binding as confirm_outcome (kilabz code-review
        BLOCKER — this must not be an unguarded fourth human-label writer). FAIL-CLOSED on an ambiguous or
        too-short prefix: a <12-hex or non-unique prefix dismisses NOTHING and returns the colliding
        full keys, so grinding a short-prefix collision is an error message, not a mislabel (design §2).

        `kind` ∈ fp|wontfix maps to dismissed_false_positive|dismissed_wontfix. `family_or_all` is
        'kilabz'|'oracle'|'all' — a dismissal writes ONE row per reviewer_family currently 'open' OR
        already-dismissed on that key (a human overrules whichever family raised it, and can CORRECT a
        prior mislabel: fp<->wontfix). DETERMINISTIC source_event 'human:<finding_key12>:<kind>' — the
        kind is IN the event so a correcting DIFFERENT-kind row is a distinct unique-index tuple
        (finding_key, reviewer_family, outcome, outcome_source, source_event) and INSERTS; the human row with the
        higher seq wins in finding_current, so the corrected label takes. Re-issuing the SAME kind is

        always mints outcome_source='human_dismiss', so the 5-col conflict is identical to the 4-col.)

        Residual v1 limitation (rare, accepted): re-affirming the ORIGINAL kind after having corrected
        AWAY from it (a flip-flop back, e.g. fp -> wontfix -> fp) won't re-win — the original fp row
        already exists (ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING) and its seq is now stale (lower than the wontfix row),
        so finding_current keeps showing wontfix. A distinct third label would win; a true flip-flop
        back to an exact prior label is the one shape v1 can't re-terminalize. Documented, not fixed.
