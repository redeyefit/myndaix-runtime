"""Concurrent worker pool proofs (against real Postgres). This is what the
lease/reclaim machinery was built for:

  1. N workers drain a queue with NO double-processing (one OK attempt per job).
  2. A crashed worker's job is recovered by the janitor and finished by another.
  3. A healthy long job survives via heartbeats (NOT reclaimed).
