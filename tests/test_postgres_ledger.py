"""PostgresLedger concurrency proofs - the production ledger under REAL contention.

This is where the design's thesis is VERIFIED, not asserted: row-locking + a
status-guarded state machine end the file-IPC bug classes. Each test races real
asyncpg connections against a real local Postgres. The naive (no-lock) version of
each verb would FAIL the matching test - that's the regression guard.

Setup (once):
    brew services start postgresql@16
    createdb runtime_test
Run:
    LEDGER_TEST_DSN=postgresql://localhost/runtime_test \\
        PYTHONPATH=src python3 tests/test_postgres_ledger.py
