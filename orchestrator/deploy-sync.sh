# deploy-sync.sh — deterministic sync + drift guard for the MANUALLY-COPIED, load-bearing
# orchestrator scripts that live OUTSIDE the repo (the autonomous-loop deploy surface).
#
# WHY: the autonomous review/fix loop runs two scripts from ~/.myndaix/orchestrator/ that are
# HAND-COPIED from the repo (a deliberate security boundary — play-fix.sh must be a real regular
# file the review worker can't hijack via a repo symlink). Nothing auto-syncs them, so a merged
# fix can silently NOT reach production. On 2026-07-24 PR#112 merged but the deployed play-fix.sh
# sat on the pre-flock version for 3 days, caught by luck not signal (see the runtime-deploy
# topology audit). This turns that silent, luck-dependent failure into a loud, deterministic one.
#
# Surface (audited — exactly these three files, everything else runs repo-direct):
#   ~/.myndaix/orchestrator/play-fix.sh      (autofix worker — anti-symlink security boundary)
#   ~/.myndaix/orchestrator/play-review.sh   (review worker, re-exec'd by the pre-push dispatcher)
#   ~/.myndaix/bin/mxr-phone                 (sshd forced-command target — the phone surface; joined
#                                             the guarded set per the phone runtime audit, item 7)
#
# Modes:
#   --check       read-only: report SAME/DRIFT of each deployed copy vs <ref>; exit 1 on any drift.
#   --apply       sync each file from <ref> (atomic, backed up, hash-verified, regular-file-asserted);
#                 stamp ~/.myndaix/orchestrator/.deployed-sha with the deployed commit.
#   --preflight   ADVISORY (always exit 0): warn if deployed copies drift OR the repo working tree
#                 HEAD != the stamped deploy sha (branch-float). Safe to call at pool start.
#
#   deploy-sync.sh <mode> [ref]      ref defaults to origin/main
#
# House rules: bash-scripts.md — set -euo pipefail, PATH pin, atomic mv, quote all, no eval.
