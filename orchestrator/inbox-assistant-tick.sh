# run overlapping the scheduled tick would pull the same slice, race the cursor CAS, and

# 3600s — that must exceed the worst LEGITIMATE tick (3 classify chunks + 5 draft composes
# at 300s each = 2400s + Gmail/backoff overhead; Oracle round-2: a 900s clear would steal a
# live long tick's lock and resurrect the exact races this lock exists to stop). Held for
# the WHOLE tick — released by the EXIT trap (which is why the python call below must NOT
# be `exec`: exec replaces the shell and the trap never fires).
