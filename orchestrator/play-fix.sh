# play-fix.sh — PR-4 autonomous fix stage v1 (HONEST-MINIMAL). MyndAIX orchestrator.
#
# HUMAN-TRIGGERED (never a git hook, never auto-on-NEEDS-FIX). Given a repo + the
# exact reviewed SHA + a fix-list, it runs ONE codex attempt in an isolated worktree
# (env-scrubbed via the runtime), captures the change as an INERT .patch, then a
# SEPARATE deterministic SANDBOXED verify re-applies it to a CLEAN checkout and runs
# the repo's tests as a *regression signal*. The verdict + the (sanitized) diff go to
# the jefe inbox. NOTHING is ever auto-applied or auto-merged.
#
#   play-fix.sh <repo_id> <base_sha> <fix-list-file>
#
# v1 NEVER emits PASS. Verdicts: NO_FIX | UNVERIFIED | TAMPERED | REGRESSION_CHECK_ONLY.
# The human diff review + manual `git apply` IS the verification; verify is a signal.
# Design: docs/phase2-pr4-fix-stage-design.md (v0.2). Spec: docs/phase2-pr4-fix-stage-spec.md.
# Hardened per cross-family code review (codex + Oracle): sandbox-must-exist-before-exec,
# write-deny sandbox, robust NUL path policy, split prompt/delivery nonce, private patch
# copy, timeout+pgroup kill, fail_to_pass required, strict job-id binding, secrets scan.

# --- global lock (one fix at a time) — KERNEL-OWNED, fd-held flock; trap reaps worktrees + bg children ---
# PRIMITIVE CHANGE (PR#112 r4): three review rounds proved the mkdir+mtime+mv lock UNSOUND — every
# CAS refinement still had a stat→mv or peek→mv window (r2 CRIT, r3 HIGH×2, r4 CRIT×2 + the
# mv-nests-into-existing-dir trap), because bash file ops can't bind a decision to an inode. An
# flock(2) on a HELD file descriptor has none of those races BY CONSTRUCTION: acquisition is one
# atomic kernel op, and the kernel releases the lock when the last fd closes — i.e. on ANY process
# death, including SIGKILL. So the stale-reaper, owner-stamp, CAS release, and stray-prune are all
# DELETED, not patched (STALE/MXR_SYNC_WAIT machinery went with them). fd 9 stays open for the
# script's whole life; python3 locks the INHERITED fd (the lock lives on the shared open-file-
# description, so it survives python's exit and dies with bash's). A hung holder blocks new fixes
# until its bounded phases (runner exec timeout / VERIFY_TIMEOUT / pgroup kills) end it — same
# accepted posture as the r1 no-heartbeat residual.
