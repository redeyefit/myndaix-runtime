# xreview.sh — MANUAL cross-family review with PHASE-AWARE routing. This CEMENTS the reviewer-family
# reliability workflow (Jefe 2026-07-10) so on-demand reviews stop being ad-hoc: the routing is
# executable + versioned, not a memory note. The autonomous push-review loop (play-review.sh) already
# encodes this for CODE; xreview is its manual, on-demand counterpart and adds the DESIGN phase.
#
#   xreview.sh code   <repo_id|abs-path> <base>..<head> [objective-file]
#       CODE review: kilabz is the GATE, run via `mxr review` (stages a de-linked read-only snapshot
#       of <head> as the confined reviewer's cwd via stdin — no argv ceiling); oracle is a WEAK
#       decorrelated backup on the SAME fenced diff, but agy is arg-channel so its prompt still hits
#       ARG_MAX at the worker — it keeps a conservative cap + loud-skip (it reviews code blind); lobster
#       synthesizes WITH its own staged snapshot of the tip (issue #83: the fabrication guard —
#       synthesis verifies disputed claims against real code; degrades to reconcile-only if staging
#       fails), under the standing rule that the primary (kilabz) re-derives adversarially and the
#       second opinion accepts fixes at face value, so a disagreement stays OPEN. A kilabz
#       failure/timeout is a HARD stop (the gate). If kilabz's staging DEGRADED (inline-only), that is
#       surfaced LOUDLY — the verdict is never falsely reported as snapshot-backed.
#
#   xreview.sh design <doc-file> [objective-file]
#       DESIGN/doc review: oracle LEADS (its whole-artifact/architecture reasoning is the sharper
#       catch on a self-contained doc); kilabz reviews for mechanical completeness + trust boundaries;
#       lobster synthesizes. Degrade-not-stop if oracle is down.
#
# WHY phase-routed (evidence): oracle(gemini/agy) reviews code BLIND (unconfined -> excluded from the
# staging seam, review-context D5), so on code it fabricates or rubber-stamps ("flawless/airtight"
# while missing 4 real holes on the fence PR-1 — and it "could not verify" 3 of the 4 issues this very
# script's own dogfood review found); kilabz(codex) is the adversarial code gate. On a DESIGN doc
# there's nothing to be blind to, and oracle's reasoning leads. See the reviewer-family-reliability
# memory. Routes around the weakness until oracle gains a confined snapshot of its own (a future rung).
